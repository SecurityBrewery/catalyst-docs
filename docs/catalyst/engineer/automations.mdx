# Automations

Automations are scripts that can be triggered in different parts of the
catalyst.

## Type

There are global automations, artifact automations and task automations.

_Global_ automations are only available for admin users and can be started
from the job view.

_Artifact_ automations are shown in the artifact popups in the tickets. They
can be used trigger enrichments or other automations for the artifact.

_Task_ automations are part of playbooks. They automate single steps of the
playbook.

Automations can be written in a way to be used in all available places, e.g. a
VirusTotal automation can be used within a playbook, as an artifact enrichment
and for direct requests globally (although the last option might not be that
useful).

## Docker Image

The docker image defines the docker image that is used as an environment for
the script.

## Script

The script file is copied to the docker container when the automation is
triggered. It can be written in any language executable in the given docker
image. The message (s. below) is passed as an input. The output from
printed to stderr is saved as log lines, while the stdout should be a single
json document that is taken as a result.

## Message

The message is passed as a json string to the script as a the first and only
command line argument. The content of the message depends on the type of the
automation.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="apple" label="Global Message" default>

A global message contains the user input in the `payload`. The `context`
element is empty. The `secrets` contains credentials to access the
catalyst.


```json
{
  "payload": {
    "thehiveurl": "https://thehive.example.org",
    "thehivekey": "yqV1tmLy+w4shJ",
    "skip_files": true,
    "keep_ids": true
  },
  "context": {},
  "secrets": {
    "catalyst_apikey": "d0169af94c70981eb5452a42fae536b6caa9be3a",
    "catalyst_apiurl": "http://catalyst:8000/api"
  }
}
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="orange" label="Artifact Message">

An artifact message contains the artifact name as the `payload`. The `context`
contains the full artifact. The `secrets` contains credentials to access the
catalyst.

```json
{
  "payload": "2.2.2.2",
  "context": {
    "artifact": {
      "name": "2.2.2.2",
      "status": "unknown",
      "type": "ip"
    }
  },
  "secrets": {
    "catalyst_apikey": "d0169af94c70981eb5452a42fae536b6caa9be3a",
    "catalyst_apiurl": "http://catalyst:8000/api"
  }
}
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="banana" label="Task Message">

A task message contains the mapped input in the `payload` as defined in the
playbook. The `context` element is contains the task, playbook and ticket.
The `secrets` contains credentials to access the catalyst.

```json
{
  "payload": {
    "default": "foobar"
  },
  "context": {
    "playbook": {
      "name": "Simple",

## Schema

The schema is only used in global automations. It is used to create input forms
based on <a href="https://json-schema.org/">JSON schemas</a>. For advanced
options like styling or more complex input
see <a href="https://koumoul-dev.github.io/vuetify-jsonschema-form/latest/">VJSF</a>.
